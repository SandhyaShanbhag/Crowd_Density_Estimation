# Crowd_Density_Estimation

A prototype based project which gives the crowd density inside the bus using IOT and predicts the real time location of the bus using the Location APIs.
These locations are saved in cloud for the travel time prediction from source to destination.A website is developed to show the results of the same. 
Designed a prototype project using IoT to estimate crowd density within buses and predict real-time bus locations via Location APIs. 
Cloud storage was utilized for travel time predictions, with results displayed on a website.
